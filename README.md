WhisperWorld is an innovative iOS application that delivers location-aware facts through spatial audio, creating the illusion that information emanates from landmarks themselves.

## Project Overview

WhisperWorld reimagines how we experience our surroundings by delivering bite-sized, context-relevant audio facts through AirPods as users move through the world. Using spatial audio technology, these facts appear to emanate from the physical direction of landmarks themselves, creating a seamless blend of digital and physical worlds.

Unlike traditional audio guides that require active engagement and planning, WhisperWorld operates in the background, intelligently determining which nearby landmarks merit attention based on user interests, landmark significance, and current context.

## Key Features

- **Spatial Audio Narration**: Experience facts that sound like they're coming from actual landmarks
- **Intelligent Context Engine**: On-device machine learning determines which landmarks merit attention
- **Privacy-First Design**: Precise location data never leaves the device
- **Battery-Efficient Operation**: Sophisticated optimizations ensure all-day use
- **Hands-Free Experience**: No manual interaction required
- **Personalized Discovery**: Content tailored to user interests and history

## Technical Implementation

WhisperWorld leverages several advanced iOS frameworks:

- **Core Location & Core Motion**: For precise geofencing and directional awareness
- **AVFoundation & Phase**: For sophisticated spatial audio positioning
- **Core ML**: For on-device relevance scoring and personalization
- **SwiftUI**: For a modern, responsive interface

## Development Status

WhisperWorld is currently in the concept and early development phase. We have completed the initial architecture design, user experience flow, and technical feasibility assessment. Core components are being prototyped to validate the spatial audio experience and battery-efficient location monitoring.

## WWDC25 Relevance

This project is being submitted as part of an application for WWDC25 sessions. WhisperWorld leverages multiple Apple frameworks in novel ways, and WWDC25 insights will be instrumental in optimizing our implementation.
